# Peace Poetry: HACKED

the Challenge is :
```text
Message: I run this website where people can read and submit peace-related poetry. I am doing this out of good will towards others, and I don't see why I would be making enemies out of this, but some real ass hole hacked my website posting a bunch of ignorant aggressive propaganda on the front page. And I made that website a while ago, and I no longer have access to it. Do you think you can hack in and change it back? Please? Oh, and bonus points if you message me the name of the bastard who did this!
My website can be found here.

## Reading the Source Code 
It was all written in one line so I used HTML Beautifier to re format it :D : https://www.freeformatter.com/html-formatter.html#ad-output

so the web page has the following code
```html


<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN"        "http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-html401-19991224/loose.dtd">

BUSH IS THE GREATEST PRESIDENT OF ALL TIME, HE SHOULD BE IN OFFICE FOREVER AND WE SHOULD NOT HOLD ELECTIONS ANYMORE HE IS THE SUPREME LEADER WE ALL MUST FOLLOW HIS ORDERS, HE IS <b>GOD</b>.<br /><br /><br />Those 'peace' advocates are nothing but hypocritical hate-spewing liberals. Can't they see that the only way to make peace is to make war? They should stop thinking so much, cut their hair, and get a job.<br /><br />

<!--Note to the webmasterThis website has been hacked, but not totally destroyed. The old website is still up. I simply copied the old index.html file to oldindex.html and remade this one. Sorry about the inconvenience.-->
```
**--> Found : oldindex.html**

## Lets Check the file (oldindex.html)
 Still written all in one line using the same beautifier we have the following 
 ```html

                        Welcome to Peace Poetry. This website features several poems crying out for freedom, liberty, justice, peace, love and understanding.  You can also submit your own poetry!<br /><br />

         </table>
      </center>
   </body>
</html>

```
**--> Found : readpoem.php , submitpoem.php**

## Checking readpoem.php:
DOnt Bother Nothing Important 
## Checking submitpoems.php
After many tests and sending many junk texts the data wont be checked as if we submitted html code or php or any other code won't be checked
so we can replace the content of the **index.html** and put it back to normal 
to do so we have to submit **../index.html** as the title of the poem and paste any html data in the poem part
```text
Sorry, you have the right idea how to beat the level, but the text you entered did not match the contents of the old website. You have to put the old website up, meaning putting up the old index.html
``
NOTE : i have tried to use **index.html or /index.html or ./index.html** the only one worked is **../index.html**

Now we are on the right track all what we need is to copy the oldindex.html file and paste it as poem
```
### Happy Hacking
